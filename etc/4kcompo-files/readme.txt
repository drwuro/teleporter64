HELLO
=====

    This game was originally developed as a PICO-8 game during midsummer time
    for a gamejam called Mid-Jam 2020. Shortly after, the decision was made to
    port it to the C64 and submit it to the Reset64 Craptastic 4K Compo 2020,
    which was due in about a week.
    
    Original PICO-8 version:

HOW TO PLAY
===========

    How does teleportation work? It's quite easy to explain. There is an
    invisible teleportation vortex, which carries the subject to its
    destination. In this game, YOU are the teleporter. Whenever a person
    enters, jour job is to recreate the vortex path using your joystick as
    quickly as possible.
    
    The vortex path is displayed on the screen for you to memorize while the
    person walks towards the teleporter. Once he enters, the path disappears
    and you have to quickly wiggle your joystick according to the path
    (left/right/up/down). PLEASE NOTE that you shouldn't try to accomplish
    this in realtime (as the teleported person is gliding along the path),
    instead try to do it __much quicker__ than that. If you're too slow, the
    teleportation process fails, resulting in the death of the person.
    
    So make sure you do a good job!
    
    There are 8 screens for you to master. Have fun!


GAME MODES
==========

    Challenge Mode: You only have one life to master all 8 levels

    Tourist Mode:   You will play through all 8 levels until you've reached
                    the end of the game, your score will be the number of
                    attempts needed (lower is better!)


IF THE GAME IS TOO HARD
=======================

    - Make sure you fully understood how to play it (the arrows in the lower
      left corner of the screen might help you understand what's going on)

    - Play Roman Werner's excellent BASIC 10-liner version of the game, which
      offers the same game idea, except that you can take your time thinking
      about where to turn next at each segment of the path
      
      (His version has been submitted to the same compo!)


SOURCE CODE
===========

    The source code will be made available after the compo at:
        https://github.com/drwuro/teleporter64
    
    Feel free to port it to other systems if you like!

a small teleportation game for the Commodore C64

this game was originally developed as a PICO-8 game during a gamejam called Mid-Jam 2020:

the C64 version was developed shortly after for Reset64 Craptastic 4K Game Compo 2020:

### how to build
- you need ACME (a 6502/C64 cross assembler) in your path
- run build.sh to build the project (out.prg will appear in bin/)
- run run_and_build.sh to build and in case of success run directly with VICE (a C64 emulator)

**note:** the reason why it's called "run_and_build.sh" (and not the other way round) is to make it easier to type and autocomplete on the cmdline
